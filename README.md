# Mediated Expression Score Regression (MESC)

MESC is a tool for estimating heritability mediated by assayed gene expression levels. See paper here: 

[Douglas Yao, Luke O'Connor, Alkes Price, Alexander Gusev. Quantifying genetic effects on disease mediated by assayed gene expression levels. Nature Genetics, 2020.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0625-2)

To use, clone the repository: 
```
