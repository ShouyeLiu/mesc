# Mediated Expression Score Regression (MESC)

MESC is a tool for estimating heritability mediated by assayed gene expression levels. See paper here: 

[Douglas Yao, Luke O'Connor, Alkes Price, Alexander Gusev. Quantifying genetic effects on disease mediated by assayed gene expression levels. Nature Genetics, 2020.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0625-2)

For a non-technical summary of the paper, see here: [Intuition behind mediated expression score regression](https://douglasyao.github.io/blogs/2020/09/16/intuition-behind-mediated-expression-score-regression.html)


To use, clone the repository: 
```
git clone https://github.com/douglasyao/mesc.git
cd mesc
```

Next, activate the conda environment:
```
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate mesc
```

MESC is now ready to use. See the [wiki](https://github.com/douglasyao/mesc/wiki) page for further documentation. For comments and questions, please contact douglasyao@g.harvard.edu.
